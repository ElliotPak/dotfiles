# Dotfiles - Bin Readme

This file details how to use each script in this folder, and what they do.

## ask-yes-no

Usage: `ask-yes-no [prompt]`

Succeeds if the user enters y, fails if the user enters n. Displays `prompt`,
if provided, before asking for input.

## bar-info

Usage: `bar-info [-g] [-p] [-l NUMBER] info-type`

Displays info such as time, date, volume, etc.  
If `-g` is included, the output will be prepended by a glyph.  
If `-p` is included, the output is padded by 1 space character on either side.  
If `-l` is included, the output is truncated to be `NUMBER` characters long.

Possible values for info-type include `time`, `time-seconds`, `date`, `volume`,
`nowplaying`, `battery`, `cpu`, `memory`, `temp`, `mounted`, and `wifi`.

## check-git-branch

Usage: `check-git-branch [repo path] [branch name] [auto/noauto] [fetch/nofetch]`

Checks if the specified branch in the specified repo is up to date.  
If `fetch` is provided, it fetches the branch before comparing. `nofetch` does
the opposite.  
If `noauto` is provided, the script asks the user whether the branch should be
pushed/pulled. If `auto` is provided, the script will always push/pull.

## check-git-repo

Usage: `check-git-repo [git url] [repo path] [auto/noauto] [fetch/nofetch]`

If the repo doesn't exist, ask if the user wants to clone it. Otherwise, calls
`check-git-branch` on all branches of the repo, passing the last two arguments
along.

## cycle-bar

Usage: `cycle-bar`

Toggles which polybars appear on each monitor (from none to the main bar to the
main and extra bars).

## fre.sh

Usage: `fre.sh OPTIONS...`

My bootstrap script. *Old and currently not being used.* Check the bottom of the
script to see what options are possible.

## i3-monitor

Usage: `i3-monitor`

Sets up my displays and moves workspaces to the correct i3 workspaces.

## launcher

Usage: `launcher [run] fzf/single-command`.

Run without `run` as an argument to start a terminal that acts as either
a rofi- or dmenu-style launcher (when `fzf` is specified) or a terminal window
that runs only one command (when `single-command` is specified).

## lock

Usage: `lock`

Uses i3lock with the faded wallpaper generated by `wallpaper`.

## modes

Usage: `modes fun/work`

When in work mode, `/etc/hosts` will contain the sites specified within the
file, blocking them. *Old and currently not being used* (because Firefox
ignores this file).

## mpd-notify

Usage: `mpd-notify [current/file]`

A "daemon" that displays notifications when a new song starts playing via mpd.
If `current` is provided, it will display what's currently playing and then
exit.  
If `file` is provided, it will instead output song info to a file called
`currentfile.txt` in whatever directory it is run in.  

# propogate-colours

Usage: `propogate-colours`

Reads in colours from standard input and sends them to the current terminals
and xresources, reloading i3 and polybar in the process.  
Note that colours are in the following order: 1 - 6, 9 - 14, 0, 7, 8, 15,
background, foreground. See `theme` and `setup-wallpaper` for why.

## setup-wallpaper

Usage: `setup-wallpaper WALLPAPER`

Sets up the specified wallpaper, creating colour caches to be used with theme,
and generating a blurred version to use with `lock`.  
The actual colours and black/white shades are retrieved separately (see wal
configs) and then concatenated to create three versions: one with purely wal
colours, one with purely colours specified in `.config`, and one with colours
from the former and black/white shades from the latter.

## startup

Usage: `startup`

Various things that run on startup (daemons etc)

## startup-fg

Usage: `startup-fg`

Various things that run on startup that either require user input or that
I want to see the output of.

## suspend

Usage: `suspend [pre/post]`

Meant to be run when the system resumes after suspending.

## swapidy

Usage: `swapidy`

If mpd is running, kill it and start mopidy, and vice versa.

## sys-info

Usage: `sys-info`

Displays info from `bar-info` as a notification.

## theme

Usage: `theme [random/swap/resume/default/wal/mixed]`

Uses `setup-wallpaper` and `propogate-colours` to set up themes.  
`swap` swaps between the three styles mentioned in `setup-wallpaper`.  
`random` picks a new random wallpaper and propogates its colours in the current
style.  
`resume` picks the previous wallpaper and propogates its colours in the current
style (Useful when restarting to get your old wallpaper and colours back).
